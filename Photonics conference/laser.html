				Daily activities, from scanning items at a grocery store checkout to playing your favorite CD, require the very precise light lasers provide. This page will contain links to resources that will allow you to explore how laser light differs from regular light, browse a timeline of laser science milestones, and learn about the Nobel Prize winning contributions of the many scientists that made the laser possible.

				A laser is an optical amplifier - a device that strengthens light waves.  Some lasers have a well-directed, very bright beam with a very specific color; others emphasize different properties, such as extremely short pulses.  The key feature is that the amplification makes light that is very well defined and reproducible, unlike ordinary light sources such as the sun or a lamp.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
				In the fifty years since its discovery, the laser has become an indispensable tool in our daily lives. The laser's many uses stem from its unique properties; for example, the ability to achieve high power while being focused to a pinpoint makes the laser ideal as a precision scalpel in medicine or as a means to slice through thick plates of steel. Other industries reliant on lasers include telecommunications, medical diagnostics, manufacturing, environmental sensing, basic scientific research, space exploration and entertainment. Learn about all the incredible laser innovations over the last 50 years here.

				Scientists and engineers continue to find new uses for the laser everyday. Some wide-reaching areas on the horizon for laser technology include improved cancer diagnoses, faster Internet speeds, clean sources of energy, black hole exploration and much more.</span>

				<p class="box" style="color: #F8F8FB;text-align: center; ">
					The roots of modern laser technology go back to a burst of innovation in the years following Theodore Maiman's demonstration of the ruby laser in 1960. Most major types of lasers were first demonstrated in those early years, but their technology has advanced greatly since then and today is on a roll.

					Lasers have achieved an amazing diversity in their first half century. Red laser pointers are commonplace as cat toys, trade-show giveaways, or bar-code readers in supermarkets. Hundreds of millions of diode lasers are mass-produced each year, vital parts of common consumer products like CD and DVD players.

					Argon-fluoride excimer lasers, a type developed in the 1970s, perform refractive surgery and write the patterns on state-of-the-art electronic chips. And the defense industry has innovated with both small and giant lasers for range-finding and weapons.
