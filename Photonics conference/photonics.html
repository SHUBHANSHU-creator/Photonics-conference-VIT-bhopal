		Photonics deals with generating, controlling, and detecting light waves. The field of Photonics is growing at a rapid pace with ever-increasing number of applications covering medical sciences spatial exploration telecommunications information processing industry and defence technology. Currently there is wide spectrum of cutting edge interdisciplinary research performed all over the world surrounding the field of Photonics.

	<p class="p2">
		The 21st century will depend as much on photonics as the 20th century depended on electronics here are some of the examples.  Social media, low cost telephone calls, video conferencing with family and friends – these are three examples of how the internet allows people around the world to feel connected in a way that has never before been possible in history. And all of this is because of fiberoptics technology.<span id="dots">...</span>

			Lighting provides safety and security, provides access to education, enhances architecture, and improves quality of life. We take it for granted and often notice it only by its absence. As cities worldwide develop, however, it becomes essential to employ new and innovative lighting design techniques and technologies that improve energy efficiency cost and control, and can be adapted easily to local needs. Solar energy is produced by harnessing heat from the sun’s rays using technologies like solar heating, solar photovoltaics (solar panels) and solar thermal electricity, amongst others. The use of solar energy has increased dramatically over the past decade to pave the way for a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. This technology is used in residential, commercial, agricultural, and even rural areas. Solar energy is becoming a crucial investment for our Earth’s future as we face climate change and natural resource shortages worldwide. Also current Photonic technologies and the emerging photonic technologies have major impact on the world economy. The business growth in the photonics industry is estimated to have more than doubled in the last few years and expected to increase manifold in the coming due to the demand for clean energy.
